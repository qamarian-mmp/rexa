# rexa: The Rexa Multi-main Programming Operating System

Rexa is a piece of software that enables multi-main programming in Golang. A tutorial for
this software is currently unavailable, but it would be in the nearest future.

__Note:__ Whatever version of Rexa you use, should also be the version of rxlib you
should use.
